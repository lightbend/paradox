# Directives

Directives are Paradox' extension points for providing customized behavior over Markdown. Directive can be recognized by the `@` sign
which signifies a directive usage. Depending on the scope of the directive you will use a different kind of syntax. Use `@` (for inline),
`@@` (leaf block), `@@@`(container block), `@@@@` or more for nested container blocks.

More directives are available via @ref[extensions](../customization/extensions.md).
