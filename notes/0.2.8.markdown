### Fixes and enhancements

- Source url. See below. [#69][69] by [@jonas][@jonas] and [@gsechaud][@gsechaud]

### Source origin url on GitHub

`$page.sourceUrl$` contains the plain text of the github source url of the current page. Works only if the associated `github.base_url` is defined. If it doesn't, this field returns a null value; then a condition testing like `$if(page.sourceUrl)$` would be necessary in this case.
Provide a new template "sourc.st" available in the generic theme which allows to display a simple plain text with the link associated to the current file.
